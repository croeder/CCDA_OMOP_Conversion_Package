""" The meatadata is 3 nested dictionaries:
    - meta_dict: the dict of all domains
    - domain_dict: a dict describing a particular domain
    - field_dict: a dict describing a field component of a domain
    These names are used in the code to help orient the reader

    An output_dict is created for each domain. The keys are the field names,
    and the values are the values of the attributes from the elements.

    REMEMBER to update the ddl.py file as well.
